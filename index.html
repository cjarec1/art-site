                <p>Maybe you're here because you want some custom art or graphics for your stream, 
                or because you wanna see what I can do, or maybe you're just curious. Whatever 
                the reason you're here, feel free to check out all of my art!<br/><br/>
                You can find all of my stuff in the appropriate sections, and if you have any questions,
                feel free to ask!</p>

                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>
                    My name is Kyarou and I'm a 23-year-old college graduate from Colorado currently 
                    living in Louisiana! I majored in Computer Science, but art has been a huge passion 
                    of mine since I was young. I also love cats and space.<br/><br/>
                    I started streaming on Twitch in July 2017 (although I'm currently on a break), and 
                    immediately was drawn to making my stream as aesthetically pleasing as possible. 
                    Soon after I realized how much I enjoyed making overlays (as well as other channel art),
                    and wanted to make them for other people as well.<br/><br/>
                    I hope you enjoy what I've created, and if you want to get in touch with me, check out 
                    my links under "Find Me."
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-lg-6">
                <h1>Information</h1>
                <p>
                    Just because I don't have something listed doesn't mean I won't create it. Feel free 
                    to ask me about anything you might not see!<br/><br/>
                    If you're interested in commissioning me for an overlay, some panels, or anything else,
                    you can contact me through any link under "Find Me."<br/><br/>
                    In your message, let me know what you're interested in commissioning, and I'll ask you 
                    for more details. Don't worry about giving me all of the information, as I'll ask you 
                    about anything I need to know.<br/><br/>
                    And most importantly: the images I have displayed are only representing what I can do and
                    showing you my style. It's not restricted to just what you're seeing. Furthermore, I'm 
                    improving every day, so I can only do better than what's displayed!<br/><br/>
                    Thanks for checking out my portfolio! Even if you can't support me monetarily, I appreciate 
                    you taking the time to see my work!
                </p>
